      <p>Hello! We are JDAN Enterprise LLC.</p>
      <p>I (Jennifer Do) started my first project in maintenance and repair and facility cleaning for a printer company in South San Francisco in 2008 as a favor to a friend. The company needed facility maintenance, repair, and cleaning due to inconsistent performance from other companies.</p>

        <p>In December 2010, my husband Hugh Do (pictured left) and I started a new company called JDAN Enterprise LLC. My background is in accounting and finance, but I also have extensive cleaning experience. Throughout my college years, I repaired and cleaned printers. I continued in this role for five years with my husband's assistance. Over the years, I received more referrals and started serving rental car companies throughout the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic in June 2020, we were referred by our former customers to perform facility maintenance and equipment repair for rental car companies' equipment throughout the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>In July 2021, we hired five full-time employees and two part-time employees to serve our customers. We clean buses, facilities, and repair equipment for the Rental Car Center and locations across the Bay Area.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>I have been told that what makes me unique and gives me an advantage is that I understand businesses and know what my clients need and want. Despite my background in accounting and finance, I also manage operations. I am passionate about what I do, and the services I provide are not limited to a specific industry or company type. Therefore, opportunities for growth are unbounded, and I am always eager to discover what the future will bring.</p>
