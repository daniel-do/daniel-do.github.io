            <h1>Hello! We are JDAN Enterprise, LLC.</h1>
            <p>I (Jennifer Do) started my first project in maintenance and repair and facility cleaning for the printer company in the South San Francisco city in 2008 as a favor to a friend. The company needed a facility maintenance and repair and cleaning because they could not have a consistent performance from other companies. </p>

              <p>In December 2010, my husband Hugh Do (pictured left) and I started a new company called JDAN Enterprise, LLC. My background is accounting and finance but I have extensive cleaning experience, repair and clean printers throughout my college years. To this day, I continue on this role for five years and with my husband's assistance. Throughout the years, I have more referred and now serving rental car companies throughout the the Bay Area. </p>
              <p>In June 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, we were referred by our former customers to perform facility maintenance and equipment repair for rental car companiesâ€™ equipment throughout the Bay Area. </p>

          <div id="text">
            <p>In July 2021, we hired five full time employees and two part time employees to service our customers. We clean buses, clean facility, repair equipment for the Rental Car Center and locations throughout the Bay Area.</p>
            <p>I have been told that what makes me unique and gives me an advantage is that I understand businesses and know what my client needs and wants. Although my background is in Accounting and Finance, I also run operations. I love what I do and the services I provide are not limited to a specific industry or company type, therefore, opportunities for growth are unbounded and I am always eager to discover what the future will bring.</p>
