            <h1>Hello! We are JDAN Enterprise, LLC.</h1>
            <p>Jennifer Do started her first project in maintenance and repair and facility cleaning for the printer company in the South San Francisco city in 2008 as a favor to a friend. The company needed a facility maintenance and repair and cleaning because they could not have a consistent performance from other companies. </p>

              <p>In December 2010, Jennifer and her husband Hugh Do (pictured left) started a new company called JDAN Enterprise, LLC. Their backgrounds are accounting and finance but they both have extensive cleaning experience, repair and clean printers throughout their college years. To this day, they continue on this role for five years with Hugh's assistance. Throughout the years, they have more referred and are now serving rental car companies throughout the the Bay Area. </p>
              <p>In June 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they were referred by their former customers to perform facility maintenance and equipment repair for rental car companiesâ€™ equipment throughout the Bay Area. </p>

          <div id="text">
            <p>In July 2021, they hired five full time employees and two part time employees to service their customers. They clean buses, clean facility, repair equipment for the Rental Car Center and locations throughout the Bay Area.</p>
            <p>They have been told that what makes me unique and gives me an advantage is that they understand businesses and know what my client needs and wants. Although their backgrounds are in Accounting and Finance, they also run operations. They love what they do and the services they provide are not limited to a specific industry or company type, therefore, opportunities for growth are unbounded and they are always eager to discover what the future will bring.</p>
